# Todo-ista App

This is a React.js ToDo List Web Application using LocalStorage, that I created during the course of completing online degree in "Digital Technology, Design and Innovation."

## The Brief
- Create a React.js application that provides To-Do List style functionality.
- The app should include a form to add To-Do items, a list of items, dynamically populated by user data and the ability for the user to remove items.
- The app should save its own state to LocalStorage.
- To-Do List items should persist if the app is restarted.
